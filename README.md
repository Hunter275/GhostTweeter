# GhostTweeter
**Periodically tweets out a random link to one of your Ghost blog post.**

Tweets are sent in the following format:
```
<post title>: <url> #<tag1> #<tag2>
```
Converts every tag into a hashtag (as long as characters are not >140)


*You must edit this code and enter in your own account authentication (see below).*

Getting your authentication:

1. Go to https://apps.twitter.com/app/new and create a new app
2. Once created, copy and paste your API key and secret (will be under "Keys and Access Tokens")
3. Create an access token, copy and paste those as well
